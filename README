my project
Go to root directory

cd ~/

Write the following code:

sudo chown -R username /Users/username

Where username is your system's username.


Since you want to use open as your $GIT_EDITOR you will need the following:

-W  Causes open to wait until the applications it opens (or that were already open) have exited.  Use with the -n flag to allow open to function as an appropriate app for the $EDITOR environment variable.

-n  Open a new instance of the application(s) even if one is already running.
This will work for that:

 git config --global --unset-all core.editor
 git config --global --add core.editor "open -W -n"

1^--> PhpSorm commit
2^--> git push

adesso devo capire come creare ed aggiornare .patch file:

git diff -u index.html > index.patch ----->Crea file patch x file index.html
git diff -u index.html  module2-solution.css > prova_vc-4.patch
(git diff --no-prefix -u . >edit_content.diff)
git diff --no-prefix -u . > prova_vc-6.patch

git status
git add *
git commit
git push

Ho modificato questo file su GitHub
 
git pull
